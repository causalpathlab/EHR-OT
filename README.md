# OTTEHR: Transfer Learning of Electronic Healthcare Records through Optimal Transport  #

This branch is adapted from UGW branch based on the suggestion from RPE to share source and target embeddings. 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_bound.ipynb to generate analysis of target error and individual terms in the derived upper bound 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_accuracy.ipynb to generate benchmarking results of OTTEHR against existing transfer learning methods
