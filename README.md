# OTTEHR: Transport-based transfer learning on Electronic Health Records with an application to detect treatment disparities #

Run mimic_exp4.py to run OTTEHR with **group_name** and **groups** updated to the appropriate values. 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_bound.ipynb to generate analysis of target error and individual terms in the derived upper bound.

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_accuracy.ipynb to generate benchmarking results of OTTEHR against existing transfer learning methods. 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_duration_diff.ipynb to generate predicted duration vs observed duration and the treatment disparity analysis based on subgroups.
