This branch is adapted from embedding branch to study treatment equity (duration in the hospital) between different population group

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_bound.ipynb to generate analysis of target error and individual terms in the derived upper bound 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_accuracy.ipynb to generate benchmarking results of OTTEHR against existing transfer learning methods
