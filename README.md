# OTTEHR: Transfer Learning of Electronic Healthcare Records through Optimal Transport with a Guided Error Bound  #

Run mimic_exp4.py to run OTTEHR with ``group_name'' and ``groups'' updated to the appropriate values. 

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_bound.ipynb to generate analysis of target error and individual terms in the derived upper bound.

Run mimic_exp/admission/mimic_exp4_accuracy.ipynb to generate benchmarking results of OTTEHR against existing transfer learning methods.
